          A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that enables users to define, create, maintain, and control access 
             to a database. The components of a DBMS can be categorized into hardware, software, data, procedures, and users.

          (a). Hardware
                   Definition: The physical devices used in storing and running the database.
                  Examples: Servers, hard drives, processors, and memory devices.
                  Role: Hardware provides the foundation where the DBMS and its data reside. Without it, the DBMS software cannot 
                                     operate.
         (b). Software
                      Definition: The set of programs and utilities that manage the database.
                     Examples: DBMS software (e.g., MySQL, Oracle Database, SQL Server).
                          Role:
                           Controls access to the database.
                           Provides an interface for users and applications to interact with the database.
                           Includes tools for creating, maintaining, and querying databases.
        (c) Data
                       Definition: The collection of related information stored in the database.
                               Types:
                            User Data: Actual data stored by users, like customer records, sales, etc.
                          Metadata: Data about the structure of the database (e.g., schema, table definitions).
                           Indexes: Special data structures that optimize query performance.
                            Role: Data is the central focus of the DBMS, which organizes, secures, and retrieves it efficiently.
       (d) Database Schema
                          Definition: The logical structure that defines the organization of the database.
                            Role: Specifies how data is stored, the relationships between data, constraints, and permissions. It is 
                               essential for maintaining the database's integrity.
        (e) Procedures
                          Definition: Rules and instructions for operating and using the DBMS.
                         Examples: Guidelines for data entry, recovery protocols, and database security.
                           Role: Ensures consistent use of the system and smooth database operations.

     A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables (also called relations) consisting of rows and 
            columns. Each row represents a unique record, and each column represents an attribute of the data.
   
                     Examples of Relational Databases:
        MySQL:

            Open-source and widely used for web applications.
            Known for its speed and reliability.
        PostgreSQL:

            Open-source and highly extensible.
            Supports advanced data types and performance optimization.
        Oracle Database:

            Commercial relational database with robust features for enterprise use.
           Includes advanced features for scalability and security.

      Microsoft SQL Server:

           A relational database developed by Microsoft.
           Known for its integration with other Microsoft products and strong analytics capabilities.


   3.
      1. Data Definition Language (DDL)
           Purpose: Defines and modifies the structure of the database, such as creating, altering, or deleting tables and schemas.
           Common Commands:
         CREATE: Creates a new database object, like a table or view.
         ALTER: Modifies an existing database object, such as adding a column to a table.
         DROP: Deletes a database object, like a table or schema.


     2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
        Purpose: Manages and manipulates the data stored in database tables.
            Common Commands:
         SELECT: Retrieves data from tables.
         INSERT: Adds new records to a table.
         UPDATE: Modifies existing records.
         DELETE: Removes records from a table.

    3. Data Control Language (DCL)
         Purpose: Manages access rights and permissions in the database.
         Common Commands:
         GRANT: Gives a user or role specific privileges.
         REVOKE: Removes privileges from a user or role.

      Primary Key
          Definition: A column (or a set of columns) in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table.
          Characteristics:
           Must contain unique values.
           Cannot contain NULL values.
           Each table can have only one primary key.


    Foreign Key
            Definition: A column (or set of columns) in one table that establishes a link between the data in two tables. It refers to 
                         the primary key in another table.
            Characteristics:
                    Can have duplicate values.
                    Can contain NULL values (unless explicitly constrained).
                    There can be multiple foreign keys in a single table.

5.
     An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the data and relationships within a database system. It is a 
                 conceptual tool used to design and model the structure of a database before it is implemented.

      1. Ease of Use
             Relational databases use tables with rows and columns, making data easy to understand and organize.
            Structured Query Language (SQL) provides a straightforward way to interact with the database, including querying, updating, 
               and managing data.
      2. Data Integrity
                Relational databases enforce rules like primary and foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints, ensuring 
                  the accuracy and consistency of the data.
                  These features help maintain entity integrity (unique identification of rows) and referential integrity (valid 
                 relationships between tables).
      3. Flexibility
                 The tabular structure allows for easy addition, deletion, or modification of data without significant changes to the 
                            database schema.
v                 Relationships between tables can be dynamically created and updated as the system evolves.
     4. Scalability
                  Relational databases can handle large amounts of data and complex queries efficiently.
                  They are suitable for small systems as well as large-scale enterprise applications.
        5. Data Security
Relational databases allow fine-grained control of user permissions and access levels.
Features like GRANT and REVOKE commands ensure only authorized users can perform specific operations.



7.
     1. Numeric Data Types
           Purpose: Store numerical values, which can be integers or decimals.
                       Examples:
                    INT or INTEGER: Whole numbers (e.g., 1, 42, -10).
                    FLOAT or DOUBLE: Numbers with decimal points (e.g., 3.14, -0.001).
                    DECIMAL or NUMERIC: Precise numbers with a fixed number of decimal places (e.g., 123.45).
     2. Character/String Data Types
           Purpose: Store text or alphanumeric data.
                        Examples:
                 CHAR(n): Fixed-length string (e.g., CHAR(10) always stores 10 characters, padding with spaces if needed).
                 VARCHAR(n): Variable-length string up to n characters (e.g., VARCHAR(50)).
                 TEXT or CLOB: Large text data (e.g., paragraphs or articles).
     3. Date and Time Data Types
            Purpose: Store dates, times, or both.
                        Examples:
                 DATE: Stores date values (e.g., 2024-11-21).
                 TIME: Stores time values (e.g., 14:30:00).
                 DATETIME or TIMESTAMP: Stores both date and time (e.g., 2024-11-21 14:30:00).
      4. Boolean Data Type
                 Purpose: Store logical values.
                        Example:
                   BOOLEAN: Represents TRUE, FALSE, or NULL (depending on the database system).

         6. Concurrent Access
                 Purpose: To enable multiple users to access the database simultaneously without conflicts.
         7. Backup and Recovery
                 Purpose: To protect data from loss and ensure recovery after system failures.
